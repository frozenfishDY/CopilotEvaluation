/**https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/ */
//You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
//Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
