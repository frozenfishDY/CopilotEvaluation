/**https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-component-size-by-common-factor/ */
//You are given an integer array of unique positive integers nums. Consider the following graph:
//There are nums.length nodes, labeled nums[0] to nums[nums.length - 1],
//There is an undirected edge between nums[i] and nums[j] if nums[i] and nums[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
//Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.


int largestComponentSize(int* nums, int numsSize){
    int result = 0;
    return result;

}
