/**https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/ */
//Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
//According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
//Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
