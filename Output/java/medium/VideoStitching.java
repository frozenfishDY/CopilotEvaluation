/**https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching/ */
//You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted time seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.
//Each video clip is described by an array clips where clips[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that the ith clip started at starti and ended at endi.
//We can cut these clips into segments freely.
//For example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].
//Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event [0, time]. If the task is impossible, return -1.
