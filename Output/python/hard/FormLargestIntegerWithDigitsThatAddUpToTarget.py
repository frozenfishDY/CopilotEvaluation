#https://leetcode.com/problems/form-largest-integer-with-digits-that-add-up-to-target/
#Given an array of integers cost and an integer target, return the maximum integer you can paint under the following rules:
#The cost of painting a digit (i + 1) is given by cost[i] (0-indexed).
#The total cost used must be equal to target.
#The integer does not have 0 digits.
#Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If there is no way to paint any integer given the condition, return "0".
