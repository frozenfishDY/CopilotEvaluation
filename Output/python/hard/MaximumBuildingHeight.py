#https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-building-height/
#You want to build n new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from 1 to n.
#However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:
#The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
#The height of the first building must be 0.
#The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.
#Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array restrictions where restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti] indicates that building idi must have a height less than or equal to maxHeighti.
#It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in restrictions, and building 1 will not be in restrictions.
#Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.
