#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-convert-binary-matrix-to-zero-matrix/
#Given a m x n binary matrix mat. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighbors if they share one edge.
#Return the minimum number of steps required to convert mat to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot.
#A binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only.
#A zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0.
