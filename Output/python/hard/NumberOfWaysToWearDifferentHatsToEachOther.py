#https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-wear-different-hats-to-each-other/
#There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40.
#Given a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person.
#Return the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other.
#Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
