#You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei], representing a prerequisite relationship between course prevCoursei and course nextCoursei: course prevCoursei has to be taken before course nextCoursei. Also, you are given the integer k.
#In one semester, you can take at most k courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the previous semesters for the courses you are taking.
#Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. The testcases will be generated such that it is possible to take every course.
