#https://leetcode.com/problems/broken-calculator/
#There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:
#multiply the number on display by 2, or
#subtract 1 from the number on display.
#Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.
