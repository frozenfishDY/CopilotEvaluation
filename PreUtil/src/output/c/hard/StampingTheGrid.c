/**https://leetcode.com/problems/stamping-the-grid/ */
//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).
//You are then given stamps of size stampHeight x stampWidth. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given restrictions and requirements:
//Cover all the empty cells.
//Do not cover any of the occupied cells.
//We can put as many stamps as we want.
//Stamps can overlap with each other.
//Stamps are not allowed to be rotated.
//Stamps must stay completely inside the grid.
//Return true if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return false.
