/**https://leetcode.com/problems/subsequence-with-the-minimum-score/ */
//You are given two strings s and t.
//You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string t.
//The score of the string is 0 if no characters are removed from the string t, otherwise:
//Let left be the minimum index among all removed characters.
//Let right be the maximum index among all removed characters.
//Then the score of the string is right - left + 1.
//Return the minimum possible score to make t a subsequence of s.
//A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
