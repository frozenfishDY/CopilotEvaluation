/**https://leetcode.com/problems/reward-top-k-students/ */
//You are given two string arrays positive_feedback and negative_feedback, containing the words denoting positive and negative feedback, respectively. Note that no word is both positive and negative.
//Initially every student has 0 points. Each positive word in a feedback report increases the points of a student by 3, whereas each negative word decreases the points by 1.
//You are given n feedback reports, represented by a 0-indexed string array report and a 0-indexed integer array student_id, where student_id[i] represents the ID of the student who has received the feedback report report[i]. The ID of each student is unique.
//Given an integer k, return the top k students after ranking them in non-increasing order by their points. In case more than one student has the same points, the one with the lower ID ranks higher.


/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
