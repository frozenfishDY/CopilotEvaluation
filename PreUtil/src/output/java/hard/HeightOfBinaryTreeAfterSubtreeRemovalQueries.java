/**https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/ */
//You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.
//You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:
//Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.
//Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
//Note:
//The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
//The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.
