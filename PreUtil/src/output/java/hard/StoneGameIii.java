/**https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii/ */
//Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
//Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
//The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
//The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
//Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
//Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they will end the game with the same score.
