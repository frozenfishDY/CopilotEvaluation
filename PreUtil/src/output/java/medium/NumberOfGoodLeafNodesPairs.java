/**https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-leaf-nodes-pairs/ */
//You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance.
//Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.
