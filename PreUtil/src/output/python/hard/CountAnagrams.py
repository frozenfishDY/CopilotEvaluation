#https://leetcode.com/problems/count-anagrams/
#You are given a string s containing one or more words. Every consecutive pair of words is separated by a single space ' '.
#A string t is an anagram of string s if the ith word of t is a permutation of the ith word of s.
#For example, "acb dfe" is an anagram of "abc def", but "def cab" and "adc bef" are not.
#Return the number of distinct anagrams of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
