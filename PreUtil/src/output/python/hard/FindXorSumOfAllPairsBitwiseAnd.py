#The XOR sum of a list is the bitwise XOR of all its elements. If the list only contains one element, then its XOR sum will be equal to this element.
#For example, the XOR sum of [1,2,3,4] is equal to 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4, and the XOR sum of [3] is equal to 3.
#You are given two 0-indexed arrays arr1 and arr2 that consist only of non-negative integers.
#Consider the list containing the result of arr1[i] AND arr2[j] (bitwise AND) for every (i, j) pair where 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length.
#Return the XOR sum of the aforementioned list.
