#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-initial-energy-to-finish-tasks/
#You are given an array tasks where tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]:
#actuali is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the ith task.
#minimumi is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the ith task.
#For example, if the task is [10, 12] and your current energy is 11, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is 13, you can complete this task, and your energy will be 3 after finishing it.
#You can finish the tasks in any order you like.
#Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.
