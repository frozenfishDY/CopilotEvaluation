#https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/
#You are given an array nums that consists of positive integers.
#The GCD of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence evenly.
#For example, the GCD of the sequence [4,6,16] is 2.
#A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.
#For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10].
#Return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of nums.
