#https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-a-matrix/
#Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].
#The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:
#The rank is an integer starting from 1.
#If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
#If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
#If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
#If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)
#The rank should be as small as possible.
#The test cases are generated so that answer is unique under the given rules.
