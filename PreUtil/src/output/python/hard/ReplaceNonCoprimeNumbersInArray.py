#https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-non-coprime-numbers-in-array/
#You are given an array of integers nums. Perform the following steps:
#Find any two adjacent numbers in nums that are non-coprime.
#If no such numbers are found, stop the process.
#Otherwise, delete the two numbers and replace them with their LCM (Least Common Multiple).
#Repeat this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.
#Return the final modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
#The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 108.
#Two values x and y are non-coprime if GCD(x, y) > 1 where GCD(x, y) is the Greatest Common Divisor of x and y.
