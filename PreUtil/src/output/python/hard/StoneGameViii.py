#https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-viii/
#Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
#There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:
#Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
#Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
#Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.
#The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.
#The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.
#Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.
