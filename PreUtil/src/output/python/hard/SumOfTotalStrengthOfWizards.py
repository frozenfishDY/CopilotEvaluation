#https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-total-strength-of-wizards/
#As the ruler of a kingdom, you have an army of wizards at your command.
#You are given a 0-indexed integer array strength, where strength[i] denotes the strength of the ith wizard. For a contiguous group of wizards (i.e. the wizards' strengths form a subarray of strength), the total strength is defined as the product of the following two values:
#The strength of the weakest wizard in the group.
#The total of all the individual strengths of the wizards in the group.
#Return the sum of the total strengths of all contiguous groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
#A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
