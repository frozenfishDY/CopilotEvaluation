#https://leetcode.com/problems/total-appeal-of-a-string/
#The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.
#For example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
#Given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.
#A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
