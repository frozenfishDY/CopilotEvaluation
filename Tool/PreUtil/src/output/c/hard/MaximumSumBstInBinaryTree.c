/**https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-bst-in-binary-tree/ */
//Given a binary tree root, return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).
//Assume a BST is defined as follows:
//The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
//The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
//Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
