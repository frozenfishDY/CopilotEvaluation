/**https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-magical-number/ */
//A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.
//Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.


int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b){
    int result = 0;
    return result;
