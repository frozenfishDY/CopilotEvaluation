/**https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-great-partitions/ */
//You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers and an integer k.
//Partition the array into two ordered groups such that each element is in exactly one group. A partition is called great if the sum of elements of each group is greater than or equal to k.
//Return the number of distinct great partitions. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//Two partitions are considered distinct if some element nums[i] is in different groups in the two partitions.

    int i,j,k;

        arr[i] = 1;
    }
