/**https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-largest-variance/ */
//The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.
//Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.
//A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

    int i,j,k;
    int* arr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*2);
    for(i=0;i<2;i++){
        arr[i] = 0;
    }
    arr[0] = 1;
    for(i=0;i<strlen(s);i++){
