/**https://leetcode.com/problems/words-within-two-edits-of-dictionary/ */
//You are given two string arrays, queries and dictionary. All words in each array comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.
//In one edit you can take a word from queries, and change any letter in it to any other letter. Find all words from queries that, after a maximum of two edits, equal some word from dictionary.
//Return a list of all words from queries, that match with some word from dictionary after a maximum of two edits. Return the words in the same order they appear in queries.


/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
