/**https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-boxes/ */
//You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.
//You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (i.e., composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k * k points.
//Return the maximum points you can get.
