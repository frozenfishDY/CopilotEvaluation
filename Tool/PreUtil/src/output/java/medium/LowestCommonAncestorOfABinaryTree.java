/**https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/ */
//Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
//According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ��The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).��
