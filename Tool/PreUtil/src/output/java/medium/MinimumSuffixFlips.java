/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-suffix-flips/ */
//You are given a 0-indexed binary string target of length n. You have another binary string s of length n that is initially set to all zeros. You want to make s equal to target.
//In one operation, you can pick an index i where 0 <= i < n and flip all bits in the inclusive range [i, n - 1]. Flip means changing '0' to '1' and '1' to '0'.
//Return the minimum number of operations needed to make s equal to target.
