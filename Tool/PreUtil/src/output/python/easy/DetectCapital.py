#https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/
#We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:
#All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
#All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
#Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
#Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.
