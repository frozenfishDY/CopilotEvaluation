#https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-n-ary-tree/
#Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
#The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
#Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
