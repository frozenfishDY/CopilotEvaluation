#https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-string-is-transformable-with-substring-sort-operations/
#Given two strings s and t, transform string s into string t using the following operation any number of times:
#Choose a non-empty substring in s and sort it in place so the characters are in ascending order.
#For example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in "14234" results in "12344".
#Return true if it is possible to transform s into t. Otherwise, return false.
#A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
