#https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-nodes-into-the-maximum-number-of-groups/
#You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.
#You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.
#Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:
#Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
#For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.
#Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.
