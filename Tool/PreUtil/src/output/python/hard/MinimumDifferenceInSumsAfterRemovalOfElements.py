#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements/
#You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
#You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:
#The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
#The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
#The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.
#For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
#Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
#Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
