#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-incompatibility/
#You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You are asked to distribute this array into k subsets of equal size such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset.
#A subset's incompatibility is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that array.
#Return the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the k subsets after distributing the array optimally, or return -1 if it is not possible.
#A subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.
