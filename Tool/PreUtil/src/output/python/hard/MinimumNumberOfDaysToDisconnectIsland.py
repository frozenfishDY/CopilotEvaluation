#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island/
#You are given an m x n binary grid grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of 1's.
#The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise is said disconnected.
#In one day, we are allowed to change any single land cell (1) into a water cell (0).
#Return the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid.
