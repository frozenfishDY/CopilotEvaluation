#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-eat-n-oranges/
#There are n oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges every day as follows:
#Eat one orange.
#If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 2 then you can eat n / 2 oranges.
#If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 3 then you can eat 2 * (n / 3) oranges.
#You can only choose one of the actions per day.
#Given the integer n, return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.
