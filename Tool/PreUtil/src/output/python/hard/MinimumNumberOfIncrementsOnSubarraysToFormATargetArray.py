#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/
#You are given an integer array target. You have an integer array initial of the same size as target with all elements initially zeros.
#In one operation you can choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.
#Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial.
#The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
