#https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-make-palindrome/
#You are given a string s consisting only of lowercase English letters.
#In one move, you can select any two adjacent characters of s and swap them.
#Return the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome.
#Note that the input will be generated such that s can always be converted to a palindrome.
