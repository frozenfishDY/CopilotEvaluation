#https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-rearrange-sticks-with-k-sticks-visible/
#There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly k sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.
#For example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.
#Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
