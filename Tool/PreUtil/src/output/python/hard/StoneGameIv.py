#https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/
#Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
#Initially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.
#Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.
#Given a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.
