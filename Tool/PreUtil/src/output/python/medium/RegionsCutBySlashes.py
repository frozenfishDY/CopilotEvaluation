#https://leetcode.com/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/
#An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.
#Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.
#Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a '' is represented as '\'.
