#https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/
#You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
#An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.
#You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.
#Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.
