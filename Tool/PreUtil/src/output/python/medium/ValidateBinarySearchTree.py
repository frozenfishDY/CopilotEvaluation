#https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/
#Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
#A valid BST is defined as follows:
#The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
#The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
#Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
