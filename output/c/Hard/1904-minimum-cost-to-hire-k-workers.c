/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/ */
//There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
//We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
//Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
//Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
//Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.


double mincostToHireWorkers(int* quality, int qualitySize, int* wage, int wageSize, int k){
    double result = 0;
    return result;
