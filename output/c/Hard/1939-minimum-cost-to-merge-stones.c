/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/ */
//There are n piles of stones arranged in a row. The ith pile has stones[i] stones.
//A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.
//Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.
