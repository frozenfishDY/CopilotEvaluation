/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/ */
//A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.
//Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.
//The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "aab"
//Output: 0
//Explanation: s is already good.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
//Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "ceabaacb"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
//Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 105
//	s contains only lowercase English letters.
