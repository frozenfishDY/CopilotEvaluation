/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-an-integer-to-0/ */
//You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:
//	Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.
//Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.
//A number x is power of 2 if x == 2i where i >= 0.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 39
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can do the following operations:
//- Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
//- Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
//- Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
//It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 54
//Output: 3
//Explanation: We can do the following operations:
//- Add 21 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
//- Add 23 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
//- Subtract 26 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
//So the minimum number of operations is 3.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= n <= 105
