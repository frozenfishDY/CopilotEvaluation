/**https://leetcode.com/problems/double-a-number-represented-as-a-linked-list/ */
//You are given the head of a non-empty linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.
//Return the head of the linked list after doubling it.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: head = [1,8,9]
//Output: [3,7,8]
//Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
//Example 2:
//Input: head = [9,9,9]
//Output: [1,9,9,8]
//Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998. 
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 104]
//	0 <= Node.val <= 9
//	The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.
