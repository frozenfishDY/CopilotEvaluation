/**https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/ */
//Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
//Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
//Example 2:
//Input: root = [1]
//Output: [[1]]
//Example 3:
//Input: root = []
//Output: []
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
//	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
