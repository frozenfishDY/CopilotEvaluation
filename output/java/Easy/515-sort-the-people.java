/**https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/ */
//You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.
//For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
//Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
//Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
//Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
//Example 2:
//Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
//Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
//Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
// 
//Constraints:
//	n == names.length == heights.length
//	1 <= n <= 103
//	1 <= names[i].length <= 20
//	1 <= heights[i] <= 105
//	names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
//	All the values of heights are distinct.
