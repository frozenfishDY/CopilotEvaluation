/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-string-length-after-removing-substrings/ */
//You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.
//You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.
//Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.
//Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
//Output: 2
//Explanation: We can do the following operations:
//- Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
//- Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
//- Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
//So the resulting length of the string is 2.
//It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "ACBBD"
//Output: 5
//Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 100
//	s consists only of uppercase English letters.
