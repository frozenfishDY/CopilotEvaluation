/**https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/ */
//The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
//Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.
//Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
