/**https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/ */
//Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
//You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
//Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
//For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
//Note:
//A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
//Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
//The input array words contains at least one word.
