/**https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/ */
//A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.
//The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:
//lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
//righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
//heighti is the height of the ith building.
//You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
//The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
//Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]
