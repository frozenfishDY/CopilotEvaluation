/**https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string/ */
//Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
//Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
//Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "abacaba"
//Output: 4
//Explanation:
//Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
//It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "ssssss"
//Output: 6
//Explanation:
//The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 105
//	s consists of only English lowercase letters.
