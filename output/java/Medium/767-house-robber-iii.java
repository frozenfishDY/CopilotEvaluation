/**https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/ */
//The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.
//Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
//Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
//Output: 7
//Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
//Example 2:
//Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
//Output: 9
//Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
//	0 <= Node.val <= 104
