/**https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/ */
//You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
//Return a list answer of size 2 where:
//	answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
//	answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
//The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.
//Note:
//	You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
//	The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
//Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
//Explanation:
//Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
//Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
//Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
//Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
//Example 2:
//Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
//Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
//Explanation:
//Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
//Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
//Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= matches.length <= 105
//	matches[i].length == 2
//	1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105
//	winneri != loseri
//	All matches[i] are unique.
