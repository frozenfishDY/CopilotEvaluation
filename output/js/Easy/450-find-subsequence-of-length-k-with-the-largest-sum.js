/**https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/ */
//You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You want to find a subsequence of nums of length k that has the largest sum.
//Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.
//A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
//Output: [3,3]
//Explanation:
//The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
//Example 2:
//Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
//Output: [-1,3,4]
//Explanation: 
//The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
//Example 3:
//Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
//Output: [3,4]
//Explanation:
//The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
//Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
//	-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
//	1 <= k <= nums.length
