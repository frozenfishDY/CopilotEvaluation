/**https://leetcode.com/problems/falling-squares/ */
//There are several squares being dropped onto the X-axis of a 2D plane.
//You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.
//Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.
//After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.
//Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.
