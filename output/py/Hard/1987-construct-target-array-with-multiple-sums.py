#https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-target-array-with-multiple-sums/
#You are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :
#let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
#choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
#You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
#Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.
