#https://leetcode.com/problems/pizza-with-3n-slices/
#There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:
#You will pick any pizza slice.
#Your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction of your pick.
#Your friend Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction of your pick.
#Repeat until there are no more slices of pizzas.
#Given an integer array slices that represent the sizes of the pizza slices in a clockwise direction, return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes that you can pick.
