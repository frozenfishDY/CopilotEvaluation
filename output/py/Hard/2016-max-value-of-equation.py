#https://leetcode.com/problems/max-value-of-equation/
#You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.
#Return the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.
#It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.
