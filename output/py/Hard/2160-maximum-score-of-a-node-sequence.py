#https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-of-a-node-sequence/
#There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1.
#You are given a 0-indexed integer array scores of length n where scores[i] denotes the score of node i. You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.
#A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:
#There is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence.
#No node appears more than once in the sequence.
#The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.
#Return the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4. If no such sequence exists, return -1.
