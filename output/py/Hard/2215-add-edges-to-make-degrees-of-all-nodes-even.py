#https://leetcode.com/problems/add-edges-to-make-degrees-of-all-nodes-even/
#There is an undirected graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and a 2D array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi. The graph can be disconnected.
#You can add at most two additional edges (possibly none) to this graph so that there are no repeated edges and no self-loops.
#Return true if it is possible to make the degree of each node in the graph even, otherwise return false.
#The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
