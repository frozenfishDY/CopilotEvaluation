#https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/
#You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
#You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.
#Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
#Â 
#Example 1:
#Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
#Output: 3
#Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
#One way to attend them all is as shown.
#Attend the first event on day 1.
#Attend the second event on day 2.
#Attend the third event on day 3.
#Example 2:
#Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
#Output: 4
#Â 
#Constraints:
#	1 <= events.length <= 105
#	events[i].length == 2
#	1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105
