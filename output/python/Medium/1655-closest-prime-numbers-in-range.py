#https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-prime-numbers-in-range/
#Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:
#	left <= nums1 < nums2 <= right .
#	nums1 and nums2 are both prime numbers.
#	nums2 - nums1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
#Return the positive integer array ans = [nums1, nums2]. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum nums1 value or [-1, -1] if such numbers do not exist.
#A number greater than 1 is called prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
# 
#Example 1:
#Input: left = 10, right = 19
#Output: [11,13]
#Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
#The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
#Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
#Example 2:
#Input: left = 4, right = 6
#Output: [-1,-1]
#Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
# 
#Constraints:
#	1 <= left <= right <= 106
